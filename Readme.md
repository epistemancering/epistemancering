#### Most of my experience is in the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly React, but I'm handy with Python as well, among other technologies. I'm always hungry for more tech to learn and more opportunities to build amazing things that improve people's lives.

#### I'm passionate about simplicity, performance, and accessibility, and sometimes about science fiction, altruism, and puzzle games. If you're grappling with a complex problem, I'd welcome the opportunity for an engaging conversation.
